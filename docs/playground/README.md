# Playground

In the following form, you can test the functionalities of the sentc sdk. The app token is from a sample app and will be reset every 30 min.

You can:

- register and login a user
- create a group
- optional invite another user into your group
- the other user can fetch your group
- encrypt in your group (or in the fetched group)
- decrypt in the group
- if you are done, click end test to delete the user and the group

Have fun :)
