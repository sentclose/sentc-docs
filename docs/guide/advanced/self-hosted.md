# Self-hosting

The sdk connects to an api. 
The api will store the encrypted user and group keys and will also manage the key rotation and group member.

## Docker

You can choose docker to run the api. To get started, download the [sentc/hosting](https://github.com/sentclose/hosting) repo.
It contains basic docker-compose to get the server running.

```bash:no-line-numbers
git clone https://github.com/sentclose/hosting
cd hosting
```

Next copy and rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and `sentc.env.sample` to `sentc.env`

The `.env` file contains config about the used container. You can change the version of each container.

Optional but recommended: Change the mysql env too.

Next you have to create a root key with the `sentc key gen tool` and paste it into `ROOT_KEY` in the `sentc.env` file.

#### Root key generation

You can use the docker image to generate a key:

```bash:no-line-numbers
docker-compose -f key_gen/docker-compose.yml up
```

Without the -d flag to get the key output. Copy your key, and then you can down the container:

```bash:no-line-numbers
docker-compose -f key_gen/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

And delete the image

```bash:no-line-numbers
docker image rm sentc/key_gen
```

### Start

The default is mariadb with redis server.

```bash:no-line-numbers
docker-compose -f mysql/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Now everything is running and you can start.

### Non default

If you are using an external Database, or a Database which is running native, then use the `mysql/docker-compose.stand_alone.yml` file.

Before starting set also the both Env: `MYSQL_HOST` (your host where the db is running), `MYSQL_DB` (the database name).

```bash:no-line-numbers
docker-compose -f mysql/docker-compose.external_db.yml up -d
```

Keep in mind that this will use the array cache as default, not redis. If you have redis also running, set the Env `CACHE` to 2
and the Env `REDIS_URL` to your running redis url instance.

To use the sqlite container, use this composed file:

```bash:no-line-numbers
docker-compose -f sqlite/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

This will start the sqlite version of the api. Make sure to place in the sqlite database in the folder: `db/sqlite`. 
You can get it from the [api repo](https://github.com/sentclose/sentc-api/blob/master/db/sqlite/db.sqlite3).

### Server

This hosting approach not be directly accessed from the outside. Use a reverse proxy like nginx to handle tls. 
Sentc itself will use http.

```text
server {
    client_max_body_size 6m;    # to make sure the file upload works
    
    server_name <your_server_name>
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3002; # redirect to your running docker container. Sentc uses port 3002 as default.
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

## SDK change

Set the base_url option in your SDK init to your hosted version to make sure that the sentc backend is not used.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
import Sentc from "@sentclose/sentc";

//init the javascript client
await Sentc.init({
    app_token: "5zMb6zs3dEM62n+FxjBilFPp+j9e7YUFA+7pi6Hi",  // <-- your app token
    base_url: "<your_api_url>"
});
```

@tab Flutter

```dart
await Sentc.init(
  appToken: "5zMb6zs3dEM62n+FxjBilFPp+j9e7YUFA+7pi6Hi",
  baseUrl: "<your_api_url>",
);
```

@tab Rust
For rust sdk set it everywhere in the code where it is asked for the base_url like StdUser::register("base_url",...).

::::

## Register a self-hosted app

You can access your dashboard by going to your address where your instance is running. 
Then simply follow the register an app [guide for creating an app](/guide/create-app/).

Use your public and secret token from this app. 

### Disable app creation

Now the registration is still open for everyone. Set the Env `CUSTOMER_REGISTER` to `0` in your `sentc.env` file and restart your docker container.
Now none can create a new account and register apps except your account.

```bash:no-line-numbers
docker-compose -f mysql/docker-compose.yml stop
```

And then start again.
