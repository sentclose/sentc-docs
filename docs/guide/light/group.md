# Group

A groups helps to gain access to resources for some users.
As long as a user is in a group, he/she can access all protected content. 

Sentc provides simple checks for your backend to see if a user is in a group. Link resources with the group.

## Create a group

Call createGroup() from the User object after logging in a user.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
//the user obj from login
const group_id = await user.createGroup();
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
//the user obj from login
String groupId = await user.createGroup();
```

::::

When you use your own backend, make a POST request to our API (https://api.sentc.com/api/v1/group) from your backend.
Remember to include the Authorization header with the JWT.

## Fetch a group

To access the data of a group, a user can fetch them from the API.
To fetch a group, use the group ID as a parameter. This returns a group object that can be used for all group-related actions.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
//the user obj from login
const group = await user.getGroup(group_id);
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
Group group = await user.getGroup(groupId);
```

::::

## Get all groups

To retrieve all group IDs where the user is a member, use this function:

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
//the user obj from login
const groups = await user.getGroups();
```

The groups are an array, and each item is from type GroupList

````ts
interface GroupList
{
	group_id: string,
	time: number,
	joined_time: number,
	rank: number,
	parent?: string
}
````

@tab Flutter

```dart
//the user obj from login
List<ListGroups> groups = await user.getGroups();
```

The groups are a list and each item is from class ListGroups

```dart
class ListGroups {
  final String groupId;
  final String time;
  final String joinedTime;
  final int rank;
  final String? parent;
}
```

::::

To fetch more groups, use pagination and pass in the last fetched item:

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
const last_item = groups[groups.length - 1];

//the user obj from login
const groups_page_two = await user.getGroups(last_item);
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
List<ListGroups> groupsPageTwo = await user.getGroups(groups.last);
```

::::

## Group rank

The user's rank in a group determines their level of access.
An administrator or creator has full control,
while a regular member may have limited privileges such as being unable to accept join requests.
Ranks are assigned as numbers ranging from 0 to 4

- 0 is the creator of a group and has full control
- 1 is an administrator and has nearly full control, except for removing the creator
- 2 can manage users: accept join requests, send invites, change user ranks (up to rank 2), and remove group members (with a rank of 2 or lower)
- 3 and 4 are normal user ranks. A new member is automatically assigned rank 4. Rank 3 can be used for other actions, such as content management.

To change a user's rank, you need the Sentc API user ID and assign a new rank number:

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
//we set the rank to 2 here
await group.updateRank("internal_user_id", 2);
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
//we set the rank to 2 here
await group.updateRank("internal_user_id", 2);
```

::::

If you have your own backend and want to change a user's rank using a secret token,
use this function to collect the input data for the API.
To change the rank, make a PUT request to the following URL with the group ID
and the input data from your backend: `https://api.sentc.com/api/v1/group/<the_group_id>/change_rank`

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
//we set the rank to 2 here
const input = await group.prepareUpdateRank("internal_user_id", 2);
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
String input = await group.prepareUpdateRank("internal_user_id", 2);
```

::::

## Invite more users

There are two methods to add more users to a group: by invitation or by join request.

### Invite a user

Inviting a user is done by a group administrator (ranks 0-2) to a non-group member.
The non-group member can choose to accept or reject the invitation.

Optionally, a rank can be set for the invited user.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
await group.invite("internal_user_id");

//with optional rank, in this case rank 1
await group.invite("internal_user_id", 1);
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
await group.invite("internal_user_id");

//with optional rank, in this case rank 1
await group.invite("internal_user_id", 1);
```

::::

A user can get invites by fetching invites or from init the client.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
const invites = await user.getGroupInvites();
```

The invites are an array, and each item is from the type GroupInviteListItem

````ts
interface GroupInviteListItem
{
	group_id: string,
	time: number
}
````

@tab Flutter
```dart
List<GroupInviteReqList> invites = await user.getGroupInvites();
```

The invites are a list and each item is a class:

```dart
class GroupInviteReqList {
  final String groupId;
  final String time;
}
```

::::

To fetch more invites, pass in the last fetched item from the function:

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
const last_item = invites[invites.length - 1];

const invites = await user.getGroupInvites(last_item);
```

@tab Flutter
```dart:no-line-numbers
List<GroupInviteReqList> invitesPageTwo = await user.getGroupInvites(invites.last);
```

::::

To accept an invitation as a user calls his function with the group id to accept:

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
The group id can be got from the GroupInviteListItem

```ts
await user.acceptGroupInvite("group_id");
```

@tab Flutter
The group id can be got from the GroupInviteReqList

```dart
await user.acceptGroupInvite("group_id");
```

::::

Or reject the invite

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
The group id can be got from the GroupInviteListItem

```ts
await user.rejectGroupInvite("<group_id>");
```

@tab Flutter
The group id can be got from the GroupInviteReqList

```dart
await user.rejectGroupInvite("<group_id>");
```

::::

### Join request

A non-group member can request to join a group by calling this function.
A group administrator can choose to accept or reject the request. 

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
await user.groupJoinRequest("<group_id>");
```

@tab Flutter

```dart
await user.groupJoinRequest("<group_id>");
```

::::

To fetch the join requests as a group admin, use this function:

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
const req = await group.getJoinRequests();
```

The requests are an array, and each item is from the type GroupJoinReqListItem

````ts
interface GroupJoinReqListItem
{
	user_id: string,
	time: number
}
````

@tab Flutter
```dart
List<GroupJoinReqList> req = await group.getJoinRequests();
```

The requests are a List of GroupJoinReqList

```dart
class GroupJoinReqList {
  final String userId;
  final String time;
  final int userType;
}
```

::::

To fetch more requests, pass in the last fetched item from the function:

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
const last_item = req[req.length - 1];

const req = await group.getJoinRequests(last_item);
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
List<GroupJoinReqList> reqPageTwo = await group.getJoinRequests(req.last);
```

::::

A group admin can accept the request like this:

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
The user id can get from the GroupJoinReqListItem.

```ts
await group.acceptJoinRequest("user_id");

//with optional rank, in this case rank 1
await group.acceptJoinRequest("user_id", 1);
```

@tab Flutter
The user id can get from the GroupJoinReqList.

```dart
await group.acceptJoinRequest("userId");

//with optional rank, in this case rank 1
await group.acceptJoinRequest("userId", 1);
```

::::

Or reject it:

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
The user id can get from the GroupJoinReqListItem.

```ts
await group.rejectJoinRequest("user_id");
```

@tab Flutter
The user id can get from the GroupJoinReqList.

```dart
await group.rejectJoinRequest("user_id");
```

::::

A user can fetch the sent join requests:

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
interface GroupInviteListItem
{
	group_id: string,
    time: number
}

const list: GroupInviteListItem[] = await user.sentJoinReq();

//to load more use the last item of the pre fetch
const list_page_two: GroupInviteListItem[] = await user.sentJoinReq(list[list.length -1]);
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
class GroupInviteReqList {
  final String groupId;
  final String time;

  const GroupInviteReqList({
    required this.groupId,
    required this.time,
  });
}

List<GroupInviteReqList> list = await user.sentJoinReq();

//to load more use the last item of the pre fetch
List<GroupInviteReqList> listPageTwo = await user.sentJoinReq(list.last);
```

::::

A user can also delete an already sent join request. The group id can be fetched from the `sentJoinReq()` function.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
await user.deleteJoinReq("<group_id>");
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
await user.deleteJoinReq("<group_id>");
```

::::

### Auto invite

A group administrator can use this function to automatically invite and accept a non-group member,
without requiring any additional actions from the new member.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
await group.inviteAuto("user_id");
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
await group.inviteAuto("user_id");
```

::::

### Stop invite

Calling this function will prevent non-group members from sending join requests and group administrators from inviting more users.
This feature can be useful for one-on-one user sessions.
After automatically inviting the other user, you can use this function to close the invitation process.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
await group.stopInvites();
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
await group.stopInvites();
```

::::

## Get group member

The fetch uses pagination to not fetch all members at once.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
const members = await group.getMember();
```

Members are an array, and each item is from the type GroupUserListItem.

````ts
interface GroupUserListItem 
{
	user_id: string,
	rank: number,
	joined_time: number,
}
````

@tab Flutter
```dart
List<GroupUserListItem> member = await group.getMember(); 
```

Members are a list of class GroupUserListItem.

```dart
class GroupUserListItem {
  final String userId;
  final int rank;
  final String joinedTime;
  final int userType;
}
```

::::

To fetch more, use the last fetched member item:

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

Members are from the type GroupUserListItem.

```ts
const last_item = members[members.length -1];

const members_page_two = await group.getMember(last_item);
```

@tab Flutter

Members are from the type GroupUserListItem.

```dart
List<GroupUserListItem> memberPageTwo = await group.getMember(member.last); 
```

::::


## Delete group member

A group member with a rank higher than 2 (0, 1, 2) can use this function to delete another member with the same or lower rank.
However, a member cannot delete themselves using this function.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
await group.kickUser("internal_user_id");
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
await group.kickUser("internal_user_id");
```

::::

## Leave a group

Every member can leave a group except the creator.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
await group.leave();
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
await group.leave();
```

::::

## Parent and child group

A group can be set as a child of a parent group, creating a hierarchical structure of groups.
All members of the parent group are automatically granted access to the child group(s)
with the same rank as in the parent group. When a new member joins the parent group,
they are automatically added as a member to all child groups.
Multiple child groups can also be created:

````
parent
    child from parent
        child from child from parent
            child from child from parent
    child from parent
````

To create a child group, call group-create in the parent group, not in the user scope

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
const group_id = await group.createChildGroup();

//get the group from a user, if not loaded, the parent group will be loaded automatically
const group = await user.getGroup(group_id);

//or get it from the parent group
const group_from_parent = await group.getChildGroup(group_id);
```

@tab Flutter

```dart
final groupId = await group.createChildGroup();

//get the group from a user, if not loaded, the parent group will be loaded automatically
final group = await await user.getGroup(groupId);

//or get it from the parent group
final groupFromParent = await group.getChildGroup(groupId); 
```

::::

To get all children of the first level use the `getChildren()` function in the group object.

It returns a List with the child group id, the child group created time, and the parent id.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
const children: GroupChildrenListItem[] = await group.getChildren();

//to get the 2nd page pass in the last child
const children_page_two: GroupChildrenListItem[] = await group.getChildren(children[children.length -1]);
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
List<GroupChildrenList> children = await group.getChildren();

//to get the 2nd page pass in the last child
final childrenPageTwo = await group.getChildren(children.last);
```

::::

## Connected groups

A group can also be a member in another group, which is not a child of this group.
Connected groups can also have children or be a child of a parent.
Groups with access to the connected group got also access to all the child groups.
A connected group can't be a member in another group, so only normal groups can be a member in a connected group.
Normal groups can't have other groups as members except their child groups.

A connected group can be created from a normal group.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
const group_id = await group.createConnectedGroup();
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
final groupId = await group.createConnectedGroup();
```

::::

To fetch the connected group, you can either fetch it from the group or from the user.
From user requires the group id which was connected to the connected group.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
// from the group
const connected_group = await group.getConnectedGroup(connected_group_id);

//from the user, the group id is needed
const connected_group_by_user = await user.getGroup(connected_group_id, group_id);
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
// from the group
final connectedGroup = await group.getConnectedGroup(connectedGroupId);

//from the user, the group id is needed
final connectedGroupByUser = await user.getGroup(connectedGroupId, groupId);
```

::::

When accessing a child group of a connected group, make sure to load the parent group first, which is connected to the user group.

To get all connected groups to a group use the `getGroups()` function in the group object.
It returns a List of groups with the group id and the group created time.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
const connected_groups: GroupList[] = await group.getGroups();

//to get the next pages, use the last item.
const connected_groups_page_two: GroupList[] = await group.getGroups(connected_groups[connected_groups.length-1]);
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
List<ListGroups> connectedGroups = await group.getGroups();

//to get the next pages, use the last item.
List<ListGroups> connectedGroupsPageTwo = await await group.getGroups(connectedGroups.last);
```

::::

Like users, groups can also send join requests to connected groups.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
await group.groupJoinRequest("<group_id>");
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
await group.groupJoinRequest("<group_id>");
```

::::

Groups can also fetch the sent join requests.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
const list: GroupInviteListItem[] = await group.sentJoinReq();

//to load more use the last item of the pre fetch
const list_page_two: GroupInviteListItem[] = await group.sentJoinReq(list[list.length -1]);
```

```ts
interface GroupInviteListItem
{
	group_id: string,
    time: number
}
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
List<GroupInviteReqList> list = await group.sentJoinReq();

//to load more use the last item of the pre fetch
List<GroupInviteReqList> listPageTwo = await group.sentJoinReq(list.last);
```

```dart
class GroupInviteReqList {
  final String groupId;
  final String time;

  const GroupInviteReqList({
    required this.groupId,
    required this.time,
  });
}
```

::::

A group can also delete an already sent join request. The group id can be fetched from the `sentJoinReq()` function.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript
```ts
await group.deleteJoinReq("<group_id>");
```

@tab Flutter
```dart
await group.deleteJoinReq("<group_id>");
```

::::

## Child groups vs. connected groups, when use what?

The problem with child groups is that it is a fixed structure and can't be changed in the future.

A connected group can be helpful if you want to give a group (and all its parents) access to another group (and all its children).
This can be used to connect resources and users, e.g.:
- user in department groups (hr, marketing, development)
- resources like customer, employee data, devops secrets
- let dev manager access group employee data and devops secrets and marketing access customer.
- Inside each department group there are multiple child groups for each subdepartment. If the manger is in the parent group, he/she can access every subgroup

The recommended approach is to use normal groups for user and connected groups for resources.

````text:no-line-numbers
parent
    child from parent                       -->              connected group
        child from child from parent                           child from connected group
            child from child from parent
    child from parent
````

## Delete a group

Only the creator (rank 0) or the admins (rank 1) can delete a group.

:::: tabs#p

@tab Javascript

```ts
await group.deleteGroup();
```

@tab Flutter

```dart
await group.deleteGroup();
```

::::

## Backend endpoints

To create and delete groups from your backend, the jwt of the creator is always required.
If the jwt is not available in some situations, you can use the following endpoints to call it with your secret token.

- Deleting a group with a delete request: `https://api.sentc.com/api/v1/group/forced/<group_id_to_delete`
    - This endpoint will delete the group
- Creating a group with a post-request: `https://api.sentc.com/api/v1/group/forced/<creator_user_id>/light`
    - This endpoint will return the group_id
- Creating a child group with a post-request: `https://api.sentc.com/api/v1/group/forced/<creator_user_id>/<parent_group_id>/child/light`
- Create a connected group with a post-request: `https://api.sentc.com/api/v1/group/forced/<creator_user_id>/<connected_group_id>/connected/light`
- Add a user to the group: `https://api.sentc.com/api/v1/group/forced/<creator_user_id>/<group_id>/invite_auto/<user_id_to_invite>/light` (post request)
- Add a group to the group: `https://api.sentc.com/api/v1/group/forced/<creator_user_id>/<group_id>/invite_auto/<user_id_to_invite>/group_light` (post request)
- Kick a user from the group: `https://api.sentc.com/api/v1/group/forced/<creator_user_id>/<group_id>/kick/<user_id_to_kick>` (delete request)
